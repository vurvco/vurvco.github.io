I should probably start by just listing them off: math education, privacy/security, cryptography, data visualization, natural language processing, calligraphy, video games, behavioral biometrics, writing research, memory and attentional disorders, architectural acoustics, minority representation in tech.

I typed so much shit in the next section I don't even really feel like filling this out.  I'm in love with language though so anything NLP or computational linguistics is fascinating to me.

I think the recurrent themes for me educational technology and social inequality.  I definitely want to work on more social impact kinds of projects.","I've got a few projects that I would like to see realized in the future: the psychometric memory transcription machine, and a biometric analysis of player behaviors in my exploratory math video game.

The Pyschometric Memory Transcription Machine is based on the idea that writing can be represented as two complementary processes: composition and revision.  The challenge is that humans are unable to do both simultaneously and tend spend time fussing written words when they can see the full trajectory of their composition.  I characterize it as a challenge because there is great therapeutic value in being able to write freely and know that your thoughts are documented while also unable to judge your words because they are not displayed on screen.  Anyway, my final implementation would be a bit like Post Secret and Chat Roulette where people can anonymously submit their memories into a database which will replay those memories at random.  I've always been profoundly influenced by the idea of a pensieve (from Harry Potter) where an individual can externalize their memories for later reflection.  This is like a collective pensieve that I imagine would trend toward a handful of distilled emotional threads.

The biometric analysis for Gamepad Studio is coming along.  I don't particularly need collaborators on it, but I will need players once I get the data capture mechanism and basic analytical structure in order.  I'm super into quantifying behavioral patterns in exploratory learning environments.  It's all about breaking education out of this shitty assessment-based framework and creating intellectual safe spaces for people to learn and play.

I'm a huge proponent of privacy/security/cryptography for everyone.  I hate the idea that only shady people use ad-blockers and private browsing or the Tor network.  I think I've become a bit of a zealot about it because from a stats/data perspective I know exactly what is going on behind the scenes and I know that it's the fucking wild west for consumer privacy violations.  There is a journalist, Wolfie Christie, that has some great pieces on privacy and technology.  I don't know how we would execute this as a collective project, but I think it's really important that we do something.

Final thought, I think it would be fun to do some presentations at public schools.  We could do a lot of good for kids.  I hate to see the technology gap exacerbate inequality.  There are a lot of fancy private schools that are developing interactive programs and courting artists like us, but to me the real need is at the places that aren't even on our radar.  Actually, now that I think of it, it would be awesome to do a presentation at one of the magnet schools like LBJ or Kealing, but insist making it available to ALL students.","Designer, Writer, Educator"
